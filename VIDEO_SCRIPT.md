# Universal FHEVM SDK - Video Demo Script

**Total Duration: ~4 minutes**

---

## üé¨ SCENE 1: Opening (30 seconds)

### Visual
- Open browser to GitHub repository
- Show the repository name and fork badge

### Script
"Hello! I'm excited to present the **Universal FHEVM SDK** - a framework-agnostic toolkit that makes building confidential dApps with FHEVM simple and intuitive.

This SDK was built for the Zama Developer Bounty Program, and it solves a key challenge: **How can developers easily integrate FHEVM encryption across different JavaScript frameworks?**

The Universal FHEVM SDK provides a unified, wagmi-inspired API that works seamlessly with React, Vue, and vanilla JavaScript."

### Key Points to Mention
- Framework-agnostic design
- Inspired by wagmi's developer experience
- Supports multiple frameworks

---

## üé¨ SCENE 2: Core Features Overview (45 seconds)

### Visual
- Scroll through the README
- Highlight the key features section
- Show the package table

### Script
"Let me show you what makes this SDK special.

First, the **modular architecture**. We have four packages:
- A framework-agnostic **core** at just 8 kilobytes
- **React hooks** with TanStack Query integration
- **Vue 3 composables** with full reactivity
- And a **Vanilla JS client** for Node.js or any JavaScript environment

Total bundle size? Only **18 kilobytes**, fully tree-shakeable.

The SDK provides complete FHEVM workflows: initialization, encryption for all data types from bool to uint256, batch encryption, decryption with KMS integration, and EIP-712 signature support."

### Key Points to Show
- Package sizes
- Framework support list
- Feature checklist

---

## üé¨ SCENE 3: Live Demo - React Application (90 seconds)

### Visual
- Open deployed demo: https://universal-fhevm-sdk-inky.vercel.app/
- Show the beautiful UI

### Script
"Now let's see it in action. This is our production-ready React demo, deployed on Vercel.

**[Connect Wallet]**
I'll start by connecting my wallet using wagmi. The SDK integrates perfectly with existing web3 tools.

**[Show Encryption Section]**
Here's where the magic happens. The encryption interface is clean and intuitive.

Let me encrypt a value:
- I'll select a data type - let's choose **uint64**
- Enter a value - let's say **42**
- And provide a contract address

**[Click Encrypt Button]**
Watch this - the SDK automatically:
1. Initializes the FHEVM instance if needed
2. Encrypts the value using Zama's fully homomorphic encryption
3. Generates the input proof
4. Returns the encrypted handles

**[Show Results]**
And here we go! We get the encrypted handles and the input proof. This data can now be sent to a smart contract while keeping the original value completely private.

Notice how we handle the FHEVM network status gracefully with a user-friendly warning instead of a harsh error message."

### Actions to Perform
1. Connect wallet (or show connected state)
2. Select encryption type
3. Enter a value
4. Enter contract address
5. Click encrypt
6. Show the encrypted result

---

## üé¨ SCENE 4: Code Walkthrough - React (45 seconds)

### Visual
- Open VS Code or GitHub
- Show `examples/react-vite/src/App.tsx` or a component

### Script
"Let me show you how simple the code is.

**[Show Provider Setup]**
First, we wrap our app with the FHEVMProvider - just like you would with wagmi or React Query.

**[Show Hook Usage]**
Then in any component, we use the hooks:
- `useFHEVM` gives us the initialization status
- `useEncrypt` handles encryption with loading states and error handling
- Everything is fully typed with TypeScript

The API is designed to feel familiar if you've used wagmi. Same patterns, same developer experience, but for FHEVM."

### Code to Show
```tsx
// Provider setup
<FHEVMProvider config={fhevmConfig}>
  <App />
</FHEVMProvider>

// Using hooks
const { isReady } = useFHEVM()
const { encrypt, isPending, data, error } = useEncrypt({
  userAddress: address
})
```

---

## üé¨ SCENE 5: Multi-Framework Support (45 seconds)

### Visual
- Show Vue example code
- Show Vanilla JS example
- Quick glimpse of Next.js example

### Script
"But here's what makes this truly universal.

**[Show Vue Code]**
The same functionality works in Vue with composables. Clean, reactive, and follows Vue's conventions.

**[Show Vanilla JS]**
Need to use it in Node.js or vanilla JavaScript? We've got you covered. Just instantiate the client and call the methods directly. No framework required.

**[Show Next.js Example]**
And for Next.js developers, we have a complete App Router example with server components support.

One SDK, any framework. That's the power of the framework-agnostic core."

### Code to Briefly Show
```vue
// Vue
const { encrypt } = useEncrypt()
```

```js
// Vanilla
const client = new FHEVMClient(config)
await client.encrypt({ ... })
```
